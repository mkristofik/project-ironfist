	"You spy a gleaming object poking up out of the ground.   You send a member of your party over to investigate.  He comes back with a golden helmet in his hands.  You realize that it must be the helmet of the legendary Anduran, the only man who was known to wear solid gold armor.",
	"You come upon a battle where a Paladin has been mortally wounded by a group of Zombies.  He asks you to take his hammer and finish what he started.  As you pick it up, it begins to hum, and then everything becomes a blur.  The Zombies lie dead, the hammer dripping with blood.  You strap it to your belt.",
	"Upon cresting a small hill, you come upon a ridiculous looking sight.  A Sprite is attempting to carry a Scepter that is almost as big as it is.  Trying not to laugh, you ask, \"Need help?\"  The Sprite glares at you and answers: \"You think this is funny?  Fine.  You can carry it.  I much prefer flying anyway.\"",
	"An old seaman tells you a tale of an enchanted masthead that he used in his youth to rally his crew during times of trouble.  He then hands you a faded map that shows where he hid it.  After much exploring, you find it stashed underneath a nearby dock.",
	"You stop to help a Peasant catch a runaway mare.  To show his gratitude, he hands you a tiny sphere.  As soon as you grasp it, you feel the magical energy drain from your limbs...",
	"While out scaring up game, your troops find a mysterious staff levitating about three feet off of the ground.  They hand it to you, and you notice an inscription.  It reads: \"Brains best brawn and magic beats might.  Heed my words, and you'll win every fight.\"",
	"A former Captain of the Guard admires your quest and gives you the enchanted Sword Breaker that he relied on during his tour of duty.",
	"A Troll stops you and says: \"Pay me 5,000 gold, or the Sword of Anduran will slay you where you stand.\"  You refuse.  The troll grabs the sword hanging from its belt, screams in pain, and runs away.  Picking up the fabled sword, you give thanks that half-witted Trolls tend to grab the wrong end of sharp objects.",
	"A dirty shovel has been thrust into a dirt mound nearby. Upon investigation, you discover it to be the enchanted shovel of the Gravediggers, long thought lost by mortals.",
	"You pass by a chest lying under a tree. Suddenly, a goblin jumps out of the chest and shrieks. Before it can raise its club, you grab it and throw it back in the chest, and tie it sealed with rope.",
    "You get a sudden urge to dig where you are standing. You dig and find a glistening metal gauntlet, mysteriously untouched by dirt. As you touch it, it leaps up and fuses itself onto your arm."
